Works Lab is a resume builder for the Indian job market: ATS-friendly resume templates, a guided
form with a live A4 preview, and PDF or Word export, all for a one-time payment with no
subscription.

**Live site:** https://resume.workslab.in

## Latest updates

**Landing page redesign**
- New product-led homepage: an interactive hero where you switch template and accent colour on a
  live resume, a before/after comparison, and a "what an ATS extracts" text demo. Every claim on
  the page is a product fact; there are no invented user counts, ratings or logos.
- Dark mode that follows your system setting by default, with a System / Light / Dark toggle.
  Sample resumes stay on white paper because they show the real product.
- Available in English, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu (landing page only). Translations
  are lazy-loaded and the Bengali, Tamil and Telugu fonts load only when selected. The
  translations are machine-written and need native-speaker review.
- Launch pricing shown as ₹300 struck through, now ₹149 (one-time, no subscription).
- The mobile top bar stays pinned with the logo and the build button. The landing page uses
  Poppins throughout; the builder and templates keep their own fonts.

**Builder** (PRs #6 and #19)
- Bullet points in work experience, projects and custom sections, with an "• Add bullet" button
  and Enter-to-continue lists. Bullets print as real lists, so ATS parsers read them as text.
- Undo / Redo with toolbar buttons and Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z.
- "Currently work here" / "Currently studying" checkboxes, plus move up / move down and
  duplicate on every entry.
- New sections: Awards & Achievements and user-defined custom sections (e.g. Volunteering,
  Publications).
- Section order panel to rearrange sections, with a reset to the default order.
- Accent colour picker with 8 presets, all readable on white and on the dark header bands.
- Word (.docx) export with real headings and bullet lists. The export code only downloads when
  someone clicks the button, so the page stays fast.

**Templates** (PR #6)
- Two new two-column templates, Sidebar and Split, bringing the total to six.

**ATS / PDF fixes** (PR #19)
- The name, title and contact line now come first in the PDF text in every template.
- Section headings no longer extract letter by letter ("P R O F E S S I O N A L").

**SEO** (PR #20)
- Every public page is generated as its own HTML file at build time, so it returns HTTP 200
  instead of GitHub Pages' 404 fallback and can be indexed.
- Unique titles, descriptions, canonical URLs and social-share tags per page, plus
  `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and JSON-LD structured data (no invented ratings or reviews).
- Template pages list who each template suits, its features, an honest ATS note and links to
  the other templates.

## Features

- **Six templates**, all driven by one registry, so the builder, the homepage gallery and the
  template pages stay in sync.
- **Live A4 preview** with page-break lines, a notice when the resume runs past one page, and Fit/50/75/100% zoom.
- **Guided form**: section navigator with completion status, writing hints, a completeness
  meter, "Load example resume" and "Clear everything".
- **Autosave** to the browser, with an honest saving indicator.
- **Export**: PDF through the browser's print pipeline (real text, not an image), Word (.docx),
  and JSON export/import to move a resume between browsers.
- **Photo upload** (optional) for templates that show one.
- **Mobile friendly**: Edit / Preview toggle and no horizontal scrolling on phones.

## Templates

| Template | Layout | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modern ATS | Single column, bold header band | Software / IT / Tech |
| Classic ATS | Single column, serif | Corporate / Finance / Operations |
| Minimal ATS | Single column, spacious | Freshers / Students |
| Executive ATS | Single column, Playfair Display name | Experienced professionals |
| Sidebar ATS | Two columns, sidebar on the left | Tech / Product / Design |
| Split ATS | Two columns, full-width header | Business / Marketing / Sales |

The single-column templates are the safest choice for applicant tracking systems. In the
two-column templates the main content comes first in the PDF, but some layout-aware parsers
may still mix the columns.

## How the PDF stays ATS-readable

PDF export uses `window.print()` on a print-only copy of the resume (`#print-root`, a direct
child of `<body>`), styled with `@media print` rules in `src/styles/global.css`. The browser
writes every field as real, selectable text. Template CSS avoids the things that break text
extraction order: `opacity` on text, wide `letter-spacing`, tables and text inside images.

## Tech stack

- [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for the dev server and build
- [react-router-dom 7](https://reactrouter.com/) (`BrowserRouter`)
- Plain CSS with custom properties (no CSS framework)
- [docx](https://docx.js.org/) for Word export, loaded on demand
- [bun](https://bun.sh/) as package manager and script runner (not npm or yarn)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and Testing Library

There is no backend. Resume data lives in the browser's `localStorage`
(key `workslab_resume_data`) and is never sent to a server.

## Getting started

```bash
bun install
bun run dev        # start the Vite dev server
```

## Scripts

```bash
bun run dev        # dev server with hot reload
bun run build      # type-check, production build to dist/, then generate per-route HTML,
                   # 404.html and sitemap.xml (scripts/prerender-routes.ts)
bun run preview    # preview the production build locally
bun run lint       # ESLint
bun run test:run   # run the Vitest suite once
bun run test       # Vitest in watch mode
```

Run `bun run lint`, `bun run test:run` and `bun run build` before opening a PR.

## Routing

- `/`: landing page
- `/builder`: resume builder (optionally `?template=<key>`); `noindex` and blocked in `robots.txt`
- `/template/:templateKey`: detail page for one template
- `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/refund`: policy pages
- anything else: not-found page

GitHub Pages only serves files, so the build writes one HTML file per route
(`dist/template/modern.html`, `dist/privacy.html`, …). GitHub Pages serves them at the clean
URLs with status 200. `dist/404.html` is the fallback for unknown URLs.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: install with bun, lint, test, build, and
deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages. `public/CNAME` keeps the custom domain.

## Configuration

- **Payment link and price:** `src/lib/config.ts` (`CONFIG.PAYMENT_LINK`, `CONFIG.PRODUCT_PRICE`).
- **Adding a template:** add its data to `src/templates/meta.ts` and a component in
  `src/templates/`, then register it in `src/templates/index.ts`. The builder, gallery, template
  page, page metadata and sitemap all pick it up automatically.
- **Page metadata:** `src/seo/routes.ts`.
